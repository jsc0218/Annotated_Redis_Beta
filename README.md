Annotated_Redis_Beta
====================

The beta version of redis with some annotations added.

It is worth learning the design idea of redis via the first version. I have made following changes in order to study the codes more easily:

1. Delete unused files and functions;

2. Split the redis.c into redis.h and redis.c to make the source file shorter; 

3. Rename some variables and functions;

4. Sort the implementation of functions according to their declaration;

5. Unify the code format, including brackets and spaces.

Fortunately, the codes are very short after these changes (3,000 code lines). Enjoy it!
